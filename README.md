<img src="docs/quic.png" width=303 height=124>

QED is an experimental multipath extension  to the QUIC protocol.

quic-go is an implementation of the [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) protocol in Go. It roughly implements the [IETF QUIC draft](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts), although we don't fully support any of the draft versions at the moment.
